This is my catalog heaven admin script unobfuscated.lua is the one that is the most recent verison I made; but I screwed up and end up leaking the source code.

for the unobfuscated script you can execute by copy the Unobfuscated.lua's content and pasting the script in to your executor, or you can execute it with loadstring. --June 24 smh I relapsed and played catalog heaven, I really need to quit this game.

The default prefix is "!" and you can change it by editing the prefix varible. Script usage example: !loopkill all 

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SillySlices/CatalogMainScript/main/Unobfuscated.lua"))()

Commands includes speed, killaura, unkillaura, antiplatform, unantiplatform, pink, green, gold, kill, nan, playmusic, explode, loopkill, unloopkill, bp, unbp, loopgod, unloopgod, blind, save, unsave, removerockets, unremoverockets, loopexplode, unloopexplode, god, whitelist, unwhitelist, damage, anchor.

Target includes me, all, others, hackers, playerName, playerDisplayName. Playertargets will get autofilled and will return all matches and may lead you to kill an unexpected victim that match the criteria.

Some commands like antiplatform or gold does not require any addictional arguments.
Antiplatform is very experimental; may not work as intended.
Any bugs you will encounter will not be fixed as I will be leaving Catalog Heaven.
It should be running fine without any errors as I have alot of pcalls, also I tested it, if it errors out, blame roblox for breaking pcall.

I am still mad at myself for leaking the source code. Somebody having my source code is fine but when they are stealing my credit, it fuels me with anger. Now that I fininshed my rant, I can hopefully sleep now.

This is my second attempt at making an Catalog Heaven Admin script, the first one I made is made with AI so I do not understand the script is doing thus I remade it. This script is very much of an improvement now as you can now call "me" or "others" in the targetplayer argument.
