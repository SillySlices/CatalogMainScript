This is my catalog heaven admin script unobfuscated.lua is the one that is the most recent verison I made; but I screwed up and end up leaking the source code.

for the unobfuscated script you can execute by copy the Unobfuscated.lua's content and pasting the script in to your executor, or you can execute it with loadstring. --June 24 smh I relapsed and played catalog heaven, I really need to quit this game.

default prefix is "!" and you can change it by editing the prefix varible.

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SillySlices/CatalogMainScript/main/Unobfuscated.lua"))()


Commands includes speed, killaura, unkillaura, antiplatform, unantiplatform, pink, green, gold, kill, nan, playmusic, explode, loopkill, unloopkill, bp, unbp, loopgod, unloopgod, blind, save, unsave, removerockets, unremoverockets, loopexplode, unloopexplode, god, whitelist, unwhitelist, damage, anchor.

Some commands like antiplatform or gold does not require any addictional arguments.
Antiplatform is very experimental; may not work as intended.
Any bugs you will encounter will not be fixed as I will be leaving Catalog Heaven.
It should be running fine without any errors as I have alot of pcalls, plus I tested it out, if it errors out, blame roblox for breaking pcall.


I am still mad at myself for leaking the source code. Somebody having my source code is fine but when they are stealing my credit, it fuels me with anger. Now that I fininshed my rant, I can hopefully sleep now.
