This is my catalog heaven admin script, main.lua is the one I made a some time ago which is obfuscated, unobfuscated.lua is the one that is the most recent verison since I screwed up and end up leaking the source code.


for the unobfuscated script you can execute by copy the Unobfuscated.lua's content and pasting the script in to your executor, or you can execute it with loadstring.

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SillySlices/CatalogMainScript/main/Unobfuscated.lua"))()

I am still mad at myself for leaking the source code. Somebody having my source code is fine but when they are stealing my credit, it fuels me with anger. Now that I fininshed my rant, I can hopefully sleep now.

To use the outdated obfuscated script it have to be like this, but it prints out weird stuff because I think is funny but you can ignore it.

getgenv().Prefix = "!";
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SillySlices/CatalogMainScript/main/Main.lua))()

If you tried to execute both script you can see that they perform similar in terms of functionality which hopefully proofs that I am the creator of the script.
