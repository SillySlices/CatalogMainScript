# Script

# Usage
The default prefix is "!" and you can change it by editing the prefix varible. Script usage examples: !loopkill all, !speed others 100.

# Commands
speed, killaura, unkillaura, pink, green, gold, kill, nan, playmusic, explode, loopkill, unloopkill, bp, unbp, loopgod, unloopgod, blind, save, unsave, removerockets, unremoverockets, loopexplode, unloopexplode, god, whitelist, unwhitelist, damage, autoanchor, autokill.

# Targets
me, all, others, hackers, PlayerName/DisplayName, bacons. 

# Notes
My targeting system will check every player's name and displayName and return all matches and may lead you to kill an unexpected victim that match the criteria.
Some commands like antiplatform or gold does not require any addictional arguments.
Note that the speed command is very buggy.
Antiplatform is very experimental; may not work as intended.
Any bugs you will encounter will not be fixed as I will be leaving Catalog Heaven.
It should be running fine without any errors as I have alot of pcalls, also I tested it, if it errors out, blame roblox for breaking pcall.
Platform kill and blind is buggy; may lead to crashes if the part is deleted by base forcefield before anything happend.
 
# My method to "fight" other scripters (very ping dependent)
step 1 !loopgod me -- It trys to make your health to math.huge.

step 2 !startanchor -- It trys to anchor as soon as you spawns.

step 4 !loopkill targetPlayer

step 5 AFK and hope the other player rage quits! 
# Known bugs
crashes the player if you use the blind command and the blind snowflake some how get destroyed

Attempts to korblox while anchored

Antiplatform hard counters this script

# Yes, I made this script

Nobody believes me for some reason. :c

# My rant

Everyone in Catalog Heaven Hates me!!!!!!!!! I dont care any more. -- July 27 2025
