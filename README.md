This is my catalog heaven admin script unobfuscated.lua is the one that is the most recent verison I made; but I screwed up and end up leaking the source code.


for the unobfuscated script you can execute by copy the Unobfuscated.lua's content and pasting the script in to your executor, or you can execute it with loadstring.

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SillySlices/CatalogMainScript/main/Unobfuscated.lua"))()

Commands includes speed,killaura,unkillaura ,antiplatform,unantiplatform,pink,green,gold,kill,nan,playmusic,explode,loopkill,unloopkill,bp,unbp,loopgod,unloopgod,blind,save,unsave,removerockets,unremoverockets,loopexplode,unloopexplode,god,whitelist,unwhitelist,damage.

I am still mad at myself for leaking the source code. Somebody having my source code is fine but when they are stealing my credit, it fuels me with anger. Now that I fininshed my rant, I can hopefully sleep now.
